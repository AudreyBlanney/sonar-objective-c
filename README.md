SonarQube Plugin for Objective C
================================

This repository hosts the Objective-C plugin for [SonarQube](http://www.sonarqube.org/). This plugin enables to analyze and track the quality of iOS (iPhone, iPad) and MacOS developments.

This plugin is not supported by SonarSource. SonarSource offers a commercial SonarSource Objective-C plugin as well. Both plugins do not offer the same functionalities/support.

###Disclaimer
This plugin is not compatible today with SonarQube 4.X+ (only 3.5). If you're using SonarQube 4.X+, your only option is to use the commercial plugin.

The development of this plugin is frozen at this time. All contributions are welcomed, at least to support SonarQube 4. If you wish to contribute, check the [Contributing](https://github.com/octo-technology/sonar-objective-c/wiki/Contributing) wiki page.

Find below an example of an iOS SonarQube dashboard:

###Download

The latest release is the 0.3.1, and it's available [here](http://bit.ly/1fSwd5I).

You can also download the latest build of the plugin from [Cloudbees](https://rfelden.ci.cloudbees.com/job/sonar-objective-c/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/target/).

In the worst case, the Maven repository is available here: http://repository-rfelden.forge.cloudbees.com/

###Prerequisites

- a Mac with Xcode...
- [SonarQube](http://docs.codehaus.org/display/SONAR/Setup+and+Upgrade) and [SonarQube Runner](http://docs.codehaus.org/display/SONAR/Installing+and+Configuring+SonarQube+Runner) installed (<4.0, see disclaimer)
- [xctool](https://github.com/facebook/xctool) ([HomeBrew](http://brew.sh) installed and ```brew install xctool```)
- [OCLint](http://docs.oclint.org/en/dev/intro/installation.html) installed. In my case the 0.7 version is failing on my project, so I recommend installing the 0.8.dev version (at least it works with oclint-0.8.dev.2888e0f). 
- [gcovr](http://gcovr.com) installed

###Installation (once for all your Objective-C projects)
- Install [the plugin](http://bit.ly/1fSwd5I) through the Update Center (of SonarQube) or download it into the $SONARQUBE_HOME/extensions/plugins directory
- Restart the SonarQube server.

###Configuration (once per project)
- Copy [sonar-project.properties](https://rawgithub.com/octo-technology/sonar-objective-c/master/sample/sonar-project.properties) in your Xcode project root folder (along your .xcodeproj file)
- Edit the *sonar-project.properties* file to match your Xcode iOS/MacOS project
- Copy [run-sonar.sh](https://rawgithub.com/octo-technology/sonar-objective-c/master/src/main/shell/run-sonar.sh) in your Xcode project root folder and make it executable

**The good news is that you don't have to modify your Xcode project to enable SonarQube!**. Ok, there might be one needed modification if you don't have a specific scheme for your test target, but that's all.

###Analysis
- Run the script ```run-sonar.sh``` in your Xcode project root folder
- Enjoy or file an issue!
